This is the list of all the needed changes that were made

- added a header title to the document
- changed from using the standard namespace
-seperated the blocks of code (exp //input hourly
// input hourly rainfall data
    std::vector<double> rainfall;
    double n;
    while (std::cin >> n) {
        rainfall.push_back(n);
    }
    if (!rainfall.size())
        return 1;

    // calculate average rainfall
    auto total = rainfall[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < rainfall.size(); ++i) {
        total += rainfall[i];
    }
    auto average = total / rainfall.size();

    // calculate heaviest rainfall
    auto max = rainfall[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < rainfall.size(); ++i) {
        if (rainfall[i] > max)
            max = rainfall[i];
    }
-how the variables were float and then changed it to double
 Now each variable is grouped with the black of code that its used in\
-added error catching statements (return 1 after input and return 0 after output)
- took out the calculation in the c++ file
